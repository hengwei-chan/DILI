In this work, a gene expression data based deep learning model was developed to predict DILI in advance by using gene expression data associated with DILI collected from ArrayExpress, and then optimized by feature gene selection and parameters optimization. In addition, the previous machine learning algorithm support vector machine (SVM) was also used to construct another prediction model based on the same datasets, comparing the model performance with the optimal DL model.
